A simple tool to help you crash another process
============================

It crashes another process by the PID you provided as first argument.

Usage:
CrashAnotherProcess.exe 1378

It helps me to test the crash handler code works correct or not. I find out no such tools are available , so I 
write one. It is pretty simple and hopefully it can help you.
